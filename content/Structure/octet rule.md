The octet rule is an observation that main group elements (periods 1–2 and 13–18) tend to be most stable when they have eight electrons in their [[valence shell]]. It is a subset of the rule that all atoms tend toward noble gas configurations. Each orbital can hold 2 $e^-$ so a filled shell will contain twice as many electrons as orbitals. $H$ follows the duet rule because its valence shell is just the 1s orbital; larger elements often follow the 18-electron rule because their valence shells have 9 total orbitals (one s, five d, and three p orbitals).

> - Oxygen has 6 $e^-$ in its valence shell, so it is often found either as $O^{2-}$ or with two covalent bonds to achieve the electron configuration of $Ne$: $[He]2s^22p^6$
> - Phosphorus has 5 $e^-$ in its valence shell, so it tends to gain 3 $e^-$ through three covalent bonds to achieve the electron configuration of $Ar$: $[Ne]3s^23p^6$
> - Bromine is often described to have 7 $e^-$ in its valence shell like F and Cl above it, but it is more accurate to say it has 17  $e^-$ from having the configuration $[Ar]4s^23d^{10}4p^5$. Either way you think about it, it only needs one more $e^-$ to have the electron configuration of $Kr$: $[Ar]4s^23d^{10}4p^6$.

## Physical explanation
Energy levels go down with increasing effective nuclear charge, but up with increasing quantum number. A figure will be key to making this point.

## Exceptions
The octet rule is more of an octet suggestion. We regularly encounter atoms that do not conform to the octet rule. Atoms that do not have a complete octet are called [[electron deficient atoms]] and those that have more than a complete octet are called [[hypervalent atoms]].
