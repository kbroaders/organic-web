Atoms in and below the third row of the periodic table can sometimes have Lewis structures with more than 8 $e^-$ around them. Examples include $[SO_4]^{2-}$, $Me_2SO$, $Ph_3PO$, or $SF_6$. Although it is traditional to draw these as having overfilled octets, it is always possible to depict [[resonance structures]] of them that do follow the octet rule (albeit with more [[formal charge|formal charges]]).

TODO: figure with expanded octet vs charged versions of molecules.

>You will likely encounter explanations for hypervalent atoms that claim [[hybridization]] using d-orbitals as an explanation. This is satisfying as an explanation, but accepted to be completely wrong. The difference in energy between s, p, and d orbitals is too large to hybridize, so hybridizations like $sp^3d^2$ are not based in reality. The bonding in these molecules is well-described by [[molecular orbital theory]] or [[quantum mechanical modeling]], but [[Lewis structures]] arenâ€™t quite up to the task. This is a reason organic chemists need to bel flexible with which [[models of bonding]].
