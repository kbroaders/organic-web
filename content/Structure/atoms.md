Atoms are the basic building blocks of all molecules. In [[organic molecules]], they are held together with [[covalent bonds]].

## Important properties:
> [!info]- Electronegativity (EN)
> How strongly an atom pulls electrons toward itself. F has the greatest EN.

> [!info]- Polarizability
> How much of a temporary dipole can be created by shifting the electron cloud around an atom. Roughly, how "sloshy" the electron cloud is. For example, S is more polarizable than O.
