The most frequently encountered octet “violators” are atoms with three valence electrons. Neutral boron or aluminum in compounds like $BH_3$ or $AlCl_3$ have only 6 $e^-$ in the valence shell: 3 from the B or Al and another three from the three covalent bonds. These compounds can acquire a filled octet (ex. $[BH_4]^-$ or $[AlCl_4]^-$), but not without becoming charged.

The other frequently encountered electron-poor atom is carbon in a [[carbocation]]. These tend to be highly reactive compounds that readily accept an electron, making them powerful [[electrophile|electrophiles]].
